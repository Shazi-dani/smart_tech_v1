## Design & Typography 

The design of this application appears to focus on usability by providing a user-friendly interface that aligns with its core functionality. Its layout likely ensures intuitive navigation, enabling users to easily access key features and perform tasks efficiently. The interface is likely responsive, ensuring compatibility across various devices and screen sizes, which enhances its accessibility. The visual hierarchy and feedback mechanisms, such as buttons, forms, and alerts, are probably crafted to guide users seamlessly through the application, minimizing confusion and errors. Overall, the design aims to create an engaging and efficient user experience, tailored to meet the specific needs of its target audience.

### Typography

The fonts I have used for this project were plain, simple & easy to read and look pleasant to the eye. I have used the [Font Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins) & on many palces the default font by bootstrap [bootstrap css](https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css) as the default typography and styling reference.

### Color Scheme

I choose colors that provided are carefully chosen for branding and user experience.

1. **White (#FFFFFF)**: Clean and minimal, often used for backgrounds to make content readable and emphasize other colors.
2. **Light Blue (#C7E4FF)**: A calming, trustworthy color, often associated with technology and professionalism.
3. **Gray (#9AA1A6)**: Neutral and balanced, typically used for secondary elements or text.
4. **Red (#DF3D4F)**: Adds vibrancy and calls attention, ideal for highlighting actions or alerts.
5. **Dark Gray (#222427) and Black (#000000)**: Bold and strong for contrast, often used for text or branding elements.
6. **Dark Blue (#173761)**: Represents professionalism, reliability, and security. Blue is commonly used in tech brands as it fosters trust, making it an important choice for conveying a dependable brand identity.

## Quantify your Product

The "Quantify Product" button on your website is a user-friendly component designed to help customers select the desired quantity of a product with ease. This button typically consists of a plus (+) and minus (-) sign surrounding a number field. By clicking the plus or minus buttons, users can increase or decrease the quantity in increments, often by one unit. This setup provides a quick, interactive way for users to adjust the number of items without needing to type or navigate complex dropdown menus, enhancing the overall shopping experience. For added convenience, some designs allow users to type a quantity directly into the field if they need a specific number that might be quicker to type.

**Component Layout:**


The quantity selector has three main parts:
- A minus button (-) on the left side to decrease the quantity.
- A number field in the center to display the current quantity. This can sometimes be editable, allowing users to type in a number directly.
- A plus button (+) on the right side to increase the quantity.
